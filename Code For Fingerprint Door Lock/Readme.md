# Instructions - 

-> There are two codes written in C++

-> Copy paste the codes in the .txt files into Arduino IDE and then run/push them into Arduino UNO

-> After installing the Adafruit Finger Sensor Libraries push the [Finger Enrolment](https://github.com/akhil218/Fingerprint-Door-Lock-Arduino-IDE/blob/master/Code%20For%20Fingerprint%20Door%20Lock/Finger%20Enrolment.txt) code into Arduino UNO through Arduino IDE

-> Then push the second program that is [Scanner Program](https://github.com/akhil218/Fingerprint-Door-Lock-Arduino-IDE/blob/master/Code%20For%20Fingerprint%20Door%20Lock/Scanner%20Program.txt) code into Arduino UNO through Arduino IDE
