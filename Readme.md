# INSTRUCTIONS - 

* The codes for the Fingerprint Door lock are present in the [Code For Fingerprint Door Lock](https://github.com/akhil218/Fingerprint-Door-Lock-Arduino-IDE/tree/master/Code%20For%20Fingerprint%20Door%20Lock) folder

* The instructions of how to operate the codes are given in that respective folder

* Before pushing/running the codes in Arduino IDE install the [Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Libraries](https://github.com/akhil218/Adafruit-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library)

### .zip file of the entire library is also added in the [.zip (library)](https://github.com/akhil218/Fingerprint-Door-Lock-Arduino-IDE/tree/master/.zip%20(library)) folder, that can be downloaded and installed directly

Secure your project with biometrics - this all-in-one optical fingerprint sensor will make adding fingerprint detection and verification super simple. These modules are typically used in safes - there's a high powered DSP chip that does the image rendering, calculation, feature-finding and searching. Connect to any microcontroller or system with TTL serial, and send packets of data to take photos, detect prints, hash and search. You can also enroll new fingers directly - up to 162 finger prints can be stored in the onboard FLASH memory. There's a red LED in the lens that lights up during a photo so you know its working.

The Rugged Panel Mount Fingerprint Sensor with Bi-Color LED Ring even has an LED ring built around the detection pad, which can be set to red, blue or purple (as well as some fading/blinking effects) for a great user experience.


Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit Fingerprint sensors
